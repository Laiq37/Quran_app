        <h2> Appendix 2</h2>
        <p class="appsource">(from: <a href="../">Quran</a> The Final Testament, by Rashad Khalifa, PhD.)</p>
        <h1> God's Messenger of the Covenant</h1>

        <div class="box" style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">
            <p>God's Messenger of the Covenant is a consolidating messenger. His mission is to purify and unify all existing religions into one: Submission (Islam).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Islam is NOT a name; it is a description of one's total submission and devotion to God ALONE, without idolizing Jesus, Mary, Muhammad, or the saints. Anyone who meets this criterion is a "Muslim" (Submitter). Therefore, one may be a Muslim
                Jew, a Muslim Christian, a Muslim Hindu, a Muslim Buddhist, or Muslim Muslim.</p>
            <br>
            <p>God's Messenger of the Covenant delivers God's proclamation that "The only religion approved by God is Submission" (<a href="../noframes/ch3.html#19">3:19</a>) and that "Anyone who seeks other than Submission as a religion, it will not be
                accepted from him/her" (<a href="../noframes/ch3.html#85">3:85</a>).</p>
            <br>
            <p>A messenger of God must present proof that he is God's messenger. Every messenger of God is supported by incontrovertible divine signs proving that he is authorized by the Almighty to deliver His messages. Moses threw down his staff and it
                turned into a serpent, Jesus healed the leprous and revived the dead by God's leave, Sãleh's sign was the famous camel, Abraham walked out of the fire, and Muhammad's miracle was the Quran (<a href="../noframes/ch29.html#50">29:50</a>-51).</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Quran (<a href="../noframes/ch3.html#81">3:81</a>, <a href="../noframes/ch33.html#7">33:7</a>, <a href="../noframes/ch33.html#40">33:40</a>) and the Bible (Malachi 3:1-3) have prophesied the advent of the consolidating messenger, God's
                Messenger of the Covenant. It is only befitting that a messenger with such a crucial mission must be supported by the most powerful miracle (<a href="../noframes/ch74.html#30">74:30</a>-35). While the miracles of previous messengers were
                limited in time and place, God's miracle supporting His Messenger of the Covenant is perpetual; it can be witnessed by anyone, at anytime, in any place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This Appendix presents physical, examinable, verifiable, and irrefutable evidence that Rashad Khalifa is God's Messenger of the Covenant.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>
            <BR> A Quranic Truth</h2>
        <p> One of the major prophecies in the Quran is that God's Messenger of the Covenant will be sent after all the prophets have come to this world, and after all of God's scriptures have been delivered. </p>
        <div class="box" style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px;">God took a covenant from the prophets, saying, "After I have given you the scripture and wisdom, a messenger will come to confirm what you have. You shall believe in him and support him." He said, "Do you agree with this, and pledge to uphold
            this covenant?" They said, "We agree." He said, "You have thus borne witness, and I am with you a witness." (3:81)
            <div style="text-align:right;">(<a href="../noframes/ch3.html#81">3:81</a>)</div>
        </div>
        <BR> Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall translated 3:81 as follows:
        <BR>
        <div class="box" style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px;">
            When Allah made (His) covenant with the Prophets, (He said): Behold that which I have given you of the Scripture and knowledge. And afterward there will come unto you a messenger, confirming that which ye possess. Ye shall believe in him and ye shall
            help him. He said: Do ye agree, and will ye take up My burden (which I lay upon you) in this (matter)? They answered: We agree. He said: Then bear witness. I will be a witness with you.</div>
        <BR> We learn from Sura 33 that Muhammad was one of the prophets who made that solemn covenant with God.
        <BR>
        <div class="box" style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px;">
            And when we exacted a covenant from the Prophets, and from thee (O Muhammad) and from Noah and Abraham and Moses and Jesus son of Mary, We took from them a solemn covenant.<br>
            <div style="text-align:right;"><a href="../noframes/ch33.html#7">33:7</a></div>
            (according to Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall)
        </div>
        <BR>
        <p>Verse 3:81, among many other verses, provides the definitions of "<em>Nabi</em>" (Prophet) and "<em>Rasoul</em>" (Messenger). Thus, "<em>Nabi</em>" is a messenger of God who delivers a new scripture, while "<em>Rasoul</em>" is a messenger commissioned
            by God to confirm existing scripture; he does not bring a new scripture. According to the Quran, every "<em>Nabi</em>" is a "<em>Rasoul</em>," but not every "<em>Rasoul</em>" is a "<em>Nabi</em>."</p>

        <p>Not every messenger was given a new scripture. It is not logical that God will give a scripture to a prophet, then ask him to keep it exclusively for himself, as stated by some Muslim "scholars" (2:42, 146, 159). Those who are not sufficiently
            familiar with the Quran tend to think that Aaron was a "<em>Nabi</em>," as stated in 19:53, who did not receive a scripture. However, the Quran clearly states that the Torah was given specifically "to both Moses and Aaron" (21:48, 37:117).</p>

        <p>We learn from the Quran, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch33.html#40">33:40</a>, that Muhammad was the last prophet (<em>Nabi</em>), but not the last messenger (<em>Rasoul</em>):</p>

        <div class="box" style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px;">
            Muhammad was not the father of any of your men; he was a messenger (Rasoul) of God and the last prophet (Nabi).
            <div style="text-align:right;">[ <a href="../noframes/ch33.html#40">33:40</a> ]</div>
        </div>

        <p>
            This crucial definition is confirmed by the Quran's mathematical code. The expression used in <a href="/quran/noframes/ch33.html#40">33:40</a> is "Muhammad Khaatum Al-Nabiyyeen" (the last prophet). The gematrical value of this expression,
            plus the sura number (33) and the verse number (40) is 1349, 19x71, while the value of the erroneous expression "Muhammad Khaatum Al-Mursaleen" (the last messenger) is not a multiple of 19.
        </p>
        <p>
            From time immemorial, it has been a human trait to reject a contemporary, living messenger. Joseph was declared "the last messenger" (40:34). Yet, many messengers came after him, including Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus, and Muhammad.</p>

        <h3> The Covenant Fulfilled</h3>
        <p> Although the prophets are dead, as far as this world is concerned, we know that their souls, the real persons, eternally exist somewhere in the universe. Several verses enjoin us from thinking that the believers who shed their bodies and departed
            this world are dead (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch2.html#154">2:154</a>, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch3.html#169">3:169</a>, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch4.html#69">4:69</a>). Although they cannot come back to our world (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch23.html#100">23:100</a>),
            they are “alive” somewhere else in the universe. <em>[Appendix <a href="appendix17.html">17</a>]</em> </p>
        <p> During my Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca, and before sunrise on Tuesday, Zul-Hijjah 3, 1391, December 21, 1971, I, Rashad Khalifa, the soul, the real person, not the body, was taken to some place in the universe where I was introduced to all the prophets
            as God's Messenger of the Covenant. I was not informed of the details and true significance of this event until Ramadan 1408.
            <BR>
            <BR> What I witnessed, in sharp consciousness, was that I was sitting still, while the prophets, one by one, came towards me, looked at my face, then nodded their heads. God showed them to me as they had looked in this world, attired in their
            respective mode of dress. There was an atmosphere of great awe, joy, and respect.
            <BR>
            <BR> Except for Abraham, none of the prophets was identified to me. I knew that all the prophets were there, including Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, Aaron, David, Noah, and the rest. I believe that the reason for revealing Abraham's identity was that
            I asked about him. I was taken aback by the strong resemblance he had with my own family - myself, my father, my uncles. It was the only time that I wondered, "Who is this prophet who looks like my relatives?" The answer came: "Abraham." No
            language was spoken. All communication was done mentally.</p>

        <p>It is noteworthy that the date of this fulfillment of the prophets' covenant was <strong><span class="ul">Zul-Hijja 3, 1391</span></strong>. If we add the month (12), plus the day (3), plus the year (1391), we get a total of 1406, 19x74. Sura
            74 is where the Quran's common denominator, the number 19, is mentioned. Note that the number 1406 is also the number of years from the revelation of the Quran to the revelation of its miracle (<a href="appendix1.html">Appendix 1</a>).</p>

        <p>The mission of God's Messenger of the Covenant is to confirm existing scriptures, purify them, and consolidate them into one divine message. The Quran states that such a messenger is charged with restoring God's message to its pristine purity,
            to lead the righteous believers&#8212;Jews, Christians, Muslims, Buddhists, Sikhs, Hindus, and others&#8212;out of darkness into the light (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch5.html#19">5:19</a> & <a href="/quran/noframes/ch65.html#11">65:11</a>).
            He is to proclaim that <em><strong>Islam (total submission to God) is the only religion acceptable by God (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch3.html#19">3:19</a>).</strong></em>
        </p>

        <div class="box" style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px;">
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lo, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me; <br> and suddenly there will come to the temple the Lord whom you <br> seek and the messenger of the covenant whom you desire.<br> Yes, he is coming, says the Lord
            of hosts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But who will endure the day of his coming?<br> And who can stand when he appears?<br> For he is like the refiner's fire, or like the fuller's lye."
            <div style="text-align:right;">[Malachi 3:1-2]</div>
        </div>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2>The Proof</h2>
        <p>The name of God's Messenger of the Covenant is mathematically coded into the Quran as "Rashad Khalifa." This is certainly the most appropriate method of introducing God's messenger to the world in the computer-age.</p>

        <p><strong>(1)</strong> As shown in Appendix 1, God's great miracle in the Quran is based on the prime number 19, and it remained hidden for 1406 years (19x74). This awesome miracle was predestined by Almighty God to be unveiled through Rashad Khalifa.
            Hundreds of Muslim and Orientalist scholars during the last 14 centuries have tried in vain, but none of them was permitted to decipher the significance of the Quranic Initials.</p>

        <p><strong>(2)</strong> The Quran is made easy for <strong>the sincere believers and seekers</strong> (<a href="../noframes/ch54.html#17">54:17</a>, 22, 32, 40 & <a href="../noframes/ch39.html#28">39:28</a>). It is an irrevocable divine law that
            no one is permitted access to the Quran, let alone its great miracle, unless he or she is a sincere believer who is given specific divine authorization (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch17.html#45">17:45</a>-46, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch18.html#57">18:57</a>,
            <a href="/quran/noframes/ch41.html#44">41:44</a>, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch56.html#79">56:79</a>). The unveiling of the Quran's miracle through Rashad Khalifa is a major sign of his messengership.</p>

            in the Quran 19 times. Nineteen is the Quran's common denominator (see <em>INDEX TO THE WORDS OF QURAN</em>, First Printing, Page 320).</p>

        <p><strong>(4)</strong> The word "Rashad" occurs in <a href="/quran/noframes/ch40.html#29">40:29</a> & 38. The word "Khalifa" occurs in <a href="/quran/noframes/ch2.html#30">2:30</a> and <a href="/quran/noframes/ch38.html#26">38:26</a>. The first
            "Khalifa" refers to a non-human "Khalifa," namely, Satan, while the second occurrence (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch38.html">Sura 38</a>), refers to a human "Khalifa." If we add the numbers of suras and verses of "Rashad" (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch40.html#29">40:29</a>,

        <p>

            <strong>(6)</strong> The total of all suras and verses where the root word "Rashada" occurs is 1369, or (19x72)+1, while the total for all occurrences of "Khalifa" is 94, (19x5)-1. The fact that "Rashada" is up by one and "Khalifa" is down
            by one pins down the name as "Rashad Khalifa," and not any "Rashad" or any "Khalifa."</p>

        <p><strong>(7)</strong> The gematrical value of "Rashad" is 505 and the value of "Khalifa" is 725 (Table 7, Appendix 1). If we add the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230) to the sura numbers, and the number of verses, from the beginning of the Quran
            to the first occurrence of "Rashada," the total is 1425, 19x75. The details are given in Table 2.</p>

        <p> <strong>(10)</strong> As shown in Table 3, if we add the numbers of all suras where the root word "Rashada" occurs, plus the number of verses, we get 1368, or 19x72.</p>

        <p><strong>(11)</strong> If we write down the sura number, followed by the number of verses per sura, followed by the individual verse numbers, from the first occurrence of the root word "Rashada" (2:186) to the last occurrence of "Rashada" (72:21),
            and place these numbers next to each other, we get a very long number that consists of 11087 digits, and is a multiple of 19. This very long number begins with the number of Sura 2, followed by the number of verses in Sura 2 from the first
            occurrence of "Rashada" at verse 186 to the end of the sura (100 verses). Thus, the beginning of the number looks like this: 2 100. The numbers of these 100 individual verses (187 to 286) are placed next to this number. Thus, the number representing
            Sura 2 looks like this: 2 100 187 188 189 ..... 285 286. The same process is carried out all the way to 72:21, the last occurrence of the root "Rashada." The complete number looks like this:</p>

        <div class="box" style="font-weight:bold;">
            <h3>2 100 187 188 189 ..... 72 21 1 2 3 ..... 19 20 21 </h3>
            <p style="margin-bottom:0;">The Sura number is followed by the number of verses, then the numbers of individual verses, from the first to the last occurrence of "Rashada" (<a href="../noframes/ch2.html#187">2:187</a> through <a href="../noframes/ch72.html#21">72:21</a>)</p>
            <p style="text-align:center;margin-top:2px;"> The complete number consists of 11087 digits, and is divisible by 19. </p>
        </div>

        <p><strong>(12)</strong> If we examine the suras and verses from the first occurrence of the root word "Rashada" to the word "Khalifa" in 38:26, we find that the sum of sura numbers and their numbers of verses is 4541, or 19x239. The details are
            in Table 4.</p>

                <h3>The Only Religion Approved by God is Submission<br> [3:19]
                </h3>
                <p>
                    <BR>
                    <strong>(14)</strong> The Quran specifies three messengers of Islam (Submission):</p>
                <p> <strong>Abraham</strong> delivered all the practices of Islam. The value of his name = 258
                    <BR>
                    <strong>Muhammad</strong> delivered the Quran. The value of his name = 92
                    <BR>
                    <strong>Rashad</strong> delivered Islam's proof of authenticity. The value of his name = 505
                    <BR> Total gematrical value of the 3 names = 258+92+505 = 855.
                    <BR> (19x45)
                </p>
                <p> The true Judaism, Christianity, and Islam will be consolidated into one religion - complete submission and absolute devotion to God ALONE.
                    <BR>
                    <BR> The existing religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are severely corrupted and will simply die out (9:33, 48:28, 61:9).
                    <BR>
                    <BR>
                    <strong>(15)</strong> Since the Quran sometimes refers to "Abraham, Ismail, and Isaac," it was suggested that Ismail and Isaac should be included. Remarkably, the addition of Ismail and Isaac gave a total that is still a multiple of
                    19. As shown in Table 5, the new total is 1235, or 19x65. This divisibility by 19 is not possible if any of the 3 names Abraham, Muhammad, or Rashad is omitted.</p>
                <h3> Why 81: Verse 81 & Sura 81</h3>
                <p> <strong>(16)</strong> God's Messenger of the Covenant is prophesied in <strong>Verse 81</strong> of Sura 3. The addition of the gematrical value of "Rashad" (505), plus the gematrical value of "Khalifa" (725), plus the Verse number (81),
                    produces 505 + 725 + 81 = 1311 = 19x69.</p>

                            words (72:2, 10, 14, & 21). By adding the value of "Rashad Khalifa" (1230), plus the sura number (72), plus the numbers of the 4 verses where "Rashada" is mentioned, we get 1230+72+2+10+14+21 = 1349 = 19x71.

                        <h3 id="distinguish">HOW TO DISTINGUISH GOD'S MESSENGER FROM A FAKE MESSENGER</h3>

                        <p> The Quran provides straightforward criteria to distinguish the true messengers of God from the false messengers:</p>
                        <p>[1] God's messenger advocates the worship of God ALONE, and the abolition of all forms of idol worship.</p>
                        <p>[2] God's messenger never asks for a wage for himself.</p>
                        <p>[3] God's messenger is given divine, incontrovertible proof of his messengership.<br><br> Anyone who claims to be God's messenger, and does not meet the three minimum criteria listed above is a false claimant.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <div class="box" style="font-weight:bold;padding:5px;">
                            <P>The most important difference between God's messenger and a fake messenger is that God's messenger is supported by God, while the fake messenger is not:</P>
                            <p>* God's messenger is supported by God's invisible soldiers (<a href="../noframes/ch3.html#124">3:124</a>-126, <a href="../noframes/ch9.html#26">9:26</a> & 40, <a href="../noframes/ch33.html#9">33:9</a>, <a href="../noframes/ch37.html#171">37:171</a>-173,
                                <a href="../noframes/ch48.html#4">48:4</a> & 7, <a href="../noframes/ch74.html#31">74:31</a>).</p>
                            <p>* God's messenger is supported by God's treasury (<a href="../noframes/ch63.html#7">63:7</a>-8).</p>
                            <p>* God's messenger, as well as the believers, are guaranteed victory and dignity, in this world and forever (<a href="../noframes/ch40.html#51">40:51</a> & <a href="../noframes/ch58.html#21">58:21</a>).</p>
                        </div> <br>

                        <p>
                            <BR> Thus, the truthfulness of God's messenger invariably prevails, while the falsehood of a fake messenger invariably, sooner or later, is exposed.
                            <BR>

                        <p>
                            <BR> As stated in the Quran, 3:81, God's Messenger of the Covenant shall confirm all the scriptures, which were delivered by all the prophets, and restore them to their original purity.

                        <p> When the believers are faced with a problem, they develop a number of possible solutions, and this invariably leads to considerable bickering, disunity, and disarray. We learn from 2:151, 3:164, and 21:107 that it is but mercy
                            from God that He sends to us messengers to provide the final solutions to our problems. We learn from 42:51 that God sends His messengers to communicate with us, and to disseminate new information. Hence the strong injunction
                            in 4:65, 80 to accept, without the slightest hesitation, the teachings delivered to us through God's messengers.
                            <BR>
                            <BR> The following is a list of the principal duties of God's Messenger of the Covenant:
