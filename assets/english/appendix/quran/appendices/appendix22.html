        <p class="appsource">(from: <a href="../">Quran</a> The Final Testament, by Rashad Khalifa, PhD.)</p>
        <H1>Jesus</H1>

        <P>The Quran, informs us that Jesus was a human messenger of God whose sole mission was to deliver God's message; he never possessed any power, and is now dead (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch4.html#171">4:171</a>, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch5.html#75">5:75</a>,
            <a href="/quran/noframes/ch5.html#117">117</a>). Those who consider Jesus to be God, or Son of God, or part of a trinity are "pagans" (<a href="/quran/noframes/ch5.html#17">5:17</a>, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch5.html#72">72</a>, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch5.html#73">73</a>).
            Outstanding Christian scholars have reached these same conclusions (THE MYTH OF GOD INCARNATE, John Hick, ed., The Westminster Press, Philadelphia, 1977 & THE MYTH MAKER, Hyam Maccoby, Harper & Row 1986). Christianity is the product of Nicene
            (AD 325).</P>

        <H3>The Bible's Jesus</H3>

        <div style="font-size:0.95em;">
            <P>Jesus proclaimed aloud: ``Whoever puts faith in me believes not so much in me as in him who sent me; ..... For I have not spoken on my own; no, the Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to speak. Since I know that his commandment
                means eternal life, whatever I say is spoken just as he instructed me.'' [ John 12:44-50 ]</P>

            <P>"I cannot do anything of myself. I judge as I hear, and my judgment is honest because I am not seeking my own will but the will of him who sent me." [ John 5:30 ]</P>

            <P>Jesus said: ``My doctrine is not my own; it comes from him who sent me.'' [ John 7:16 ]</P>

            <P>"Men of Israel, listen to me! Jesus the Nazorean was a man whom God sent to you with miracles, wonders, and signs as his credentials. These God worked through him in your midst, as you well know." [ Acts 2:22 ]</P>

            <P>``...The man who hears my word and has faith in him who sent me possesses eternal life.'' [ John 5:24 ]</P>

            <P>"Whoever welcomes me welcomes, not me, but him who sent me." [ Mattew 10:40, Mark 9:37, Luke 9:48, & John 13:20 ]</P>

            <P>``...I have not come of myself. I was sent by One who has the right to send, and him you do not know. I know him because it is from him I come; he sent me.'' [ John 7:28-29 ]</P>

            <P>Jesus looked up to heaven and said, ``...Eternal life is this: to know you, the only true God, and him whom you have sent, Jesus Christ.'' [ John 17:1-3 ]</P>

            <P>All who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God. [ Romans 8:14 ]</P>

            <P>Jesus looked upward and said, ``Father, I thank you for having heard me. I know that you always hear me but I have said this for the sake of the crowd, that they may believe that you sent me.'' [ John 11:41-42 ]</P>

            <P>As he was setting out on a journey a man came running up, knelt down before him and asked, ``Good Teacher, what must I do to share in everlasting life?'' Jesus answered, ``Why do you call me good? No one is good but God alone.'' [ Mark 10:17-18
                ]</P>

            <P>``None of those who call me `Lord' will enter the kingdom of God, but only the one who does the will of my Father in heaven." [ Matthew 7:21 ]</P>

            <P>``...Go to my brothers and tell them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.' '' [ John 20:17 ]</P>

            <P>``God is my Lord and your Lord; you shall worship Him alone. This is the right path." [ Quran <a href="/quran/noframes/ch3.html#51">3:51</a>, <a href="/quran/noframes/ch19.html#36">19:36</a>, & <a href="/quran/noframes/ch43.html#64">43:64</a>                ]</P>

            <P>Trinity, the doctrine of God taught by Christians that asserts that God is one in essence but three in ``person,'' Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Neither the word Trinity, nor the explicit doctrine as such, appears in the New Testament, nor
                did Jesus and his followers intend to contradict the Shema in the Old Testament: ``Hear O Israel: The Lord our God is one'' (Deut. 6:4). [ Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1975 ]</P>

        <TABLE class="box">
            <tr>
                <td>Jesus' soul was raised, i.e., he was put to death prior to the arrest and crucifixion of his body. Thus, his persecutors arrested, tortured, and crucified an empty body - Jesus was already gone to the world of souls (<a href="../suras/ch3.html#55">3:55</a>,
                    <a href="../suras/ch4.html#157">4:157</a>).

        <H3>Jesus' Death</H3>

        <P>This has been the single most controversial subject in the world. The Quran's miraculous mathematical code has now provided the final answer to this topic:</P>

        <div style="font-size:0.95em;">
            <P> They plotted and schemed, <br> but so did God, <br> and God is the best schemer. <br> Thus, God said, ``O Jesus, <br> I am putting you to death, <br> and raising you to Me; <br> I will save you from the disbelievers.'' [ Quran <a href="/quran/noframes/ch3.html#54">3:54</a>-55
                ]</P>

            <P>They claimed that they killed the Messiah, <br> Jesus, the son of Mary, the messenger of God! <br> In fact, they never killed him; <br> they never crucified him; <br> they were led to believe that they did. [ Quran <a href="/quran/noframes/ch4.html#157">4:157</a>                ]</P>
        </div>

        <P>Mercifully, God has given our generation a living example of a person whose soul departed this world, but his body continued to live for 19 months. On November 25, 1984, doctors at the Humana Hospital of Louisville, Kentucky removed the diseased
            heart of Mr. William Schroeder and replaced it with a plastic and metal pump (<em>THE NEW YORK TIMES</em>, Monday, November 26, 1984).</P>

        <P>On the 19th day after this historic operation - Thursday, December 13, 1984 - Mr. Schroeder, the soul, the real person, departed this world. Mr. Schroeder died. But his body continued to function with the artificial heart implanted in his body.
            The world was told that he "probably suffered a stroke" (<em>THE NEW YORK TIMES</em>, December 14, 1984). Significantly, only one day before Mr. Schroeder's departure, he talked with President Ronald Reagan on national TV, and demanded that
            the Social Security Administration send his overdue check. He was perfectly alert. From the moment "he suffered a stroke," he did not recognize the day or time, nor his family members. In fact, Mr. Scroeder was no longer in this world.</P>

        <P>The Gospels state clearly that the arrested body of Jesus was oblivious to the events surrounding it:</P>

        <div style="font-size:0.95em;">
            <P>The chief priests, meanwhile, <br> brought many accusations against Jesus. <br> Pilate interrogated him again: <br> "Surely you have some answer? <br> See how many accusations <br> they are leveling against you." <br> But greatly to Pilate's
                surprise, <u><br>
  Jesus made no further response</u>. [ Mark 15:3-5 ]</P>

            <P>Herod was extremely pleased to see Jesus. From the reports about him he had wanted for a long time to see him, and he was hoping to see him work some miracles. He questioned Jesus at considerable length, but <u>Jesus made no response</u>.
                The chief priests and scribes were at hand to accuse him vehemently. Herod and his guards then treated him with contempt and insult. [ Luke 23:8-11 ]</P>

            <P>The Savior said to me, "He whom you saw on the tree, glad and laughing, this is the living Jesus. But this one into whose hands and feet they drive the nails is the fleshly part. [Apocalypse of Peter, VII, 3, 81] from <em>THE NAG HAMMADI LIBRARY</em>                (Harper & Row, 1977, James M. Robinson, ed, Page 339).</P>
        </div>

        <P>The facts that (1) Mr. Schroeder's soul departed on the 19th day after the operation, and (2) his body survived for 19 months, are uncanny reminders that God wanted the world to know the parallel between Schroeder's situation, and the proven account
            of Jesus' departure prior to the arrest, torture, and crucifixion of his soulless body.
